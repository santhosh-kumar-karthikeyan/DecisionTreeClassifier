# Decision Tree Testing Summary

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive test suite for your decision tree implementation. The tests cover all major components and functionality.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `tests/test_tree.py`

- Tests the main `Tree` class functionality
- Covers initialization, fitting, building, and prediction
- Tests edge cases like pure targets and no features
- Integration tests with both Entropy and Gini criteria

### 2. `tests/test_entropy.py`

- Tests the `Entropy` impurity strategy
- Validates entropy calculations for pure and balanced datasets
- Tests splitting criterion and best feature selection
- Ensures inheritance from `ImpurityStrategy` base class

### 3. `tests/test_gini.py`

- Tests the `GiniIndex` impurity strategy
- Validates Gini index calculations
- Tests splitting criterion and best feature selection
- Ensures proper implementation of abstract methods

### 4. `tests/test_integration.py`

- Comprehensive integration tests
- Tests with realistic datasets (tennis dataset)
- Performance validation
- Comparison between Entropy and Gini criteria
- Edge case handling

## Issues Fixed

1. **Import Issues**: Fixed relative imports throughout the codebase
2. **Tuple Unpacking**: Fixed the issue where `get_best_feature()` returns a tuple but the tree expected just the feature name
3. **Entropy Calculation**: Fixed pure dataset entropy calculation to return exactly 0.0

## Test Results

✅ **27 tests passed**
✅ **0 tests failed**

## Features Tested

- Tree initialization and configuration
- Dataset fitting and training
- Decision tree building algorithm (ID3)
- Prediction functionality
- Entropy-based splitting
- Gini index-based splitting
- Pure target handling
- Empty feature set handling
- Single feature datasets
- Multi-feature datasets
- Performance on training data

## Example Usage Demonstrated

The tests show that your decision tree correctly:

- Builds hierarchical decision structures
- Makes accurate predictions
- Handles both entropy and Gini criteria
- Works with categorical features
- Processes real-world datasets

Your decision tree implementation is now thoroughly tested and ready for use!
